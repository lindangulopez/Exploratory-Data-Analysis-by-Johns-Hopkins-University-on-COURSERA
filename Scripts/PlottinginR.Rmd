There are three key plotting systems in R, the Base, which is a type of artist's palette, model,  a Lattice System, which allows to specify an entire plot specified by one function and the conditioning ggplot2 with mixed elements of Base and Lattice.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Plotting in R:

- The Base Plotting System


```{r }
library(datasets)
data(cars)
with(cars, plot(speed, dist))

```

##  Lattice Plot


```{r }
library(lattice)
state <- data.frame(state.x77, region = state.region)
xyplot(Life.Exp ~ Income | region, data = state, layout = c(4, 1))


```

## The ggplot2 System


```{r }

library(ggplot2)
data(mpg)
qplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg)

```
