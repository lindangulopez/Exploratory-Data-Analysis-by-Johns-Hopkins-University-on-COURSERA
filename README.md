Course 4 of 10 in the [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) 

### [Exploratory Data Analysis:](https://www.coursera.org/learn/exploratory-data-analysis?specialization=jhu-data-science) 
Covers the essential exploratory techniques for summarizing data. These techniques are typically applied before formal modeling commences and can help inform the development of more complex statistical models. Exploratory techniques are also important for eliminating or sharpening potential hypotheses about the world that can be addressed by the data. Instructors also cover in detail the plotting systems in R as well as some of the basic principles of constructing data graphics as well as some of the common multivariate statistical techniques used to visualize high-dimensional data. The course is and complemented by [swirl demos](https://github.com/swirldev/swirl_courses/tree/master/Exploratory_Data_Analysis).

This course can be applied to multiple Specializations or Professional Certificates programs. Completing this course will count towards your learning in any of the following programs, the [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) as well as the [Data Science: Foundations using R Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-foundations-r).

SKILLS YOU WILL GAIN: ` Cluster Analysis - Ggplot2 - R Programming - Exploratory Data Analysis `

There are three key plotting systems in R, the [Base](https://rpubs.com/lindangulopez/656288), which is a type of artist's palette, model,  a [Lattice System](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lattice/lattice.pdf), which allows to specify an entire plot specified by one function and the conditioning ggplot2 with mixed elements of Base and Lattice.

[Base plotting on graphic devices](https://rpubs.com/lindangulopez/656565) was explored, the [first assignment](https://github.com/lindangulopez/ExData_Plotting1/tree/master/figure) used data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set”

### [Dataset](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip): Electric power consumption [20Mb]
Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.
The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:
- https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption

- Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
- Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
- Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
- Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
- Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
- Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
- Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
- Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
- Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
